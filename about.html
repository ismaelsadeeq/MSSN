    <h4>About MSSN</h4>
    <div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="details">
    <p>MSSN is both a spiritual and a social revolution which quietly crept into the Nigerian society at the very right time that a revolution was direly in need for Muslim youths. If Islam enjoys a hitherto denied official recognition in Nigeria today, it is mostly due to that miraculous revolution.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="info">
    <p>It all started like a dream in April 1954 when a student of Methodist Boys High School (MBHS) Lagos, Tajudeen Aromasodu, now of blessed memory, in clairvoyance muted a unique idea. He proposed an association of all Muslim students in Nigeria starting with Lagos secondary schools. His intention was to create a forum of unity through a common identity for Nigerian Muslim youths of secondary school age. Such a forum was to enable them to agitate for their rights and defend those rights for their common interest. That was at a time when Muslim school pupils could hardly pass through secondary schools in Southern Nigeria without getting forcefully converted into adherents of another religion.

      Muslim children seeking Western education in those days were seen as trespassers or usurpers despite paying the demanded fees. Besides denying Muslim pupils their rights to worship according to their belief, the Christian missionaries who owned most schools in those days used the schools as an instrument of forceful conversion. Thus, most of the Muslim boys and girls who attended Christian missionary schools either ended up becoming Christians or were forced to drop out of schools if they rejected conversion.
      
      The focus at that time was probably not beyond Lagos which was then Nigeria’s federal capital and the seat of the colonial rulers. He quickly contacted a few other Muslim students of like minds in Lagos and, together, they decided to invite two delegates from each of the then seven most prominent schools in Lagos. Thus, fourteen of such students (boys and girls) formed the pioneer membership of what was destined to become a proverbial almond tree of formidable nature. The seven schools were: Kings College, Lagos; Queens College, Yaba; Methodist Boys High School, Lagos; CMS Grammar School, Bariga; Ahmadiyya College (now Anwarul Islam Model College), Agege; Methodist Girls High School, Yaba and Baptist Academy, Obanikoro.
      
      That nucleus body held its inaugural meeting at Ansar-ud-Deen Primary School, Alakoro, Lagos, on April 18, 1954. It was at that meeting that a proposal which had earlier been sent out to the mentioned schools was formally adopted. And, a resolution was taken to draft the constitution of the Society which was ratified thereafter. Since its establishment, the Society (MSS) had fought for the liberation of the Nigerian Muslim Students in particular and the Ummah at large. Within a year of the Society‘s formation, its branches spread to cover more schools in Lagos, Abeokuta, Ibadan, Ilesha, Ijebu-Ode, and Ikorodu. Two years later, the Society’s presence covered virtually all government schools in the Northern Region.
      
      The Society was known as “Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria” (MSSN) after it had been registered with the then Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs. It was given Certificate of Incorporation on the 14th day of October, 1982. Initially, there were few branches of the Society at post-primary and post-secondary institutions. However, today things have changed with the establishment of new institutions year in, year out throughout the country.
      
      The Society has a constitution that regulates its operations within its hierarchical levels and its relationship with other organizations.
      The society, Muslim Students' Society of Nigeria, Mautech Chapter is the meeting point for all Muslim Students in Institution, graduate and Post Graduates as well as Muslims who across the state. Frankly speaking, this society has one of the largest spread of society in (religious or otherwise) in the whole of Nigeria</p>
